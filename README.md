Second Semester of NUS Btech Computing

Introduction to Computing and Programming 2
NUS BTech Computing

Hello!! Welcome to the new semester. 
Glad too see you. Done well for surviving the first semester.
Few Ground Rules.
This is own personal Repo with possible errors and mistakes. 
You are an asshole if you copy line by line for codes. PLAGIARISM!!!
If you hate me, sorry. Feel free to alt+F4 .
This is not done by a professional so, don't complain.
Can make changes and comment on Programming using Pull requests.
Feel free to do so to study the files. Kudos.
